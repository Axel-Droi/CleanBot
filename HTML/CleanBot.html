            Our Mission   
        </h1>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Develop an environmentally conscious robot that can autonomously collect trash</li>
            <li>Integrate AI/ML models for object detection and classification</li>
            <li>Simulate real-world terrain handling (beach, grass, concrete, etc.)</li>
            <li>Build an interactive web dashboard for telemetry data (battery, location, torque, object count)</li>
            <li>Open-source the design for use in global clean-up initiatives</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            As this project runs and CleanBot collects more recyclable waste, we hope to partner with local facilities, like redemption centers and recycling facilities, where we can turn in the recyclable waste for money, which we aim to donate to charity (We hope to donate every penny earned by trash collection to charity!).
