# CleanBot
CleanBot is a solar-powered, AI-enabled robot designed to autonomously detect, collect, and dispose of litter in public spaces like parks, beaches, and sidewalks. Using a Jetson Nano, YOLOv8, and LiDAR, it identifies trash in real time while avoiding people, pets, and obstacles to promote cleaner, smarter communities.
